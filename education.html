Taska or Tadika Manja Dinamik is the name of my kindergarten. I went to this kindergarten until I was six years old. I go to kindergarten at 7 a.m. early in the morning and my mother will come to pick me up at 6 p.m. I have studied a lot of subjects in kindergarten, including English, Mathematics, Arts, and Islamic education, which involves reading the Qur'an and Iqra. Since I was little, I have  a deep interest for reading books and stories. Consequently, on the day I graduated from kindergarten, I was chosen to read a story about the Popeye cartoon which is in English when I was six years old.

I began wearing glasses when I was seven years old since I was born prematurely. This is a result of premature babies not having had enough time to fully grow and develop before delivery. My younger sister was born that year as well. My sister and I are seven years apart, which is quite a huge gap. Even so, we still get along really well. I received numerous awards in primary school for my academic and attitude accomplishments. I aced the two major exams with excellent grades. In the UPKK, I received 8As, and in the UPSR, 5As. I was also honoured with student figures award.

I attended an all-girls school for my secondary education. In year 2018, I passed my PT3 exam with 9As, 1B, and 1C. Therefore, I was chosen to continue my studies in the science stream during form 4. After two years, I got 7As, 1B, and 2Cs for my SPM. Chemistry, Physics, and Addmath are the science stream subjects for which I received grades of B and C. Biology is a difficult subject to carry since I cannot drop Chemistry and Addmath which I failed during my form 4. For this reason, I dropped Biology while I was in form 5. Then, I realized that science stream is not for me and decided to try different course for my Diploma.

I further my Diploma in Information Management at UiTM Kedah. I make a lot of friends here and be apart of supportive and united class which is Class C. As classmates, we seldom get into heated confrontations because we will always resolve conflicts amicably. As we approach the end of the semester, our friendships remain strong. We sincerely hope that we will be able to follow our plans and graduate on time. Some of us decide to work after earning our Diplomas, while the others will continue their education in Degree level. For me, I am planning to continue my Degree in System Management after this.
